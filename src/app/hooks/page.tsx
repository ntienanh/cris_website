        The Custom Hooks section in ZenUI Library provides a collection of custom hooks designed to simplify complex
        functionality, helping developers build better applications faster. With over 32+ hooks (and more on the way),
        these resources include essentials like state management, API handling, event listeners, and UI logic tailored
        to address common development needs. Each hook is carefully curated to offer efficient, reusable solutions that
        integrate seamlessly into any React project.
